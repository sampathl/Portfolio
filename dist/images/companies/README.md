## How to Get Official Company Logos

Many companies provide official logos for media use:
- **Franklin Templeton**: Check their investor relations or media center
- **FINRA**: Visit their press/media resources
- **Dropbox**: Check their brand guidelines or press kit
- **Tech Mahindra**: Look for their media resources or brand guidelines

### Option 2: Company Websites
- Download logos from company websites (usually in footer or about sections)
- Look for "Media Resources" or "Press Kit" sections

### Option 3: Brand Guidelines
- Search for "[Company Name] brand guidelines" or "logo usage"
- Many companies have public brand guidelines with downloadable assets

## Replacing Placeholder Logos

1. **Download official logo** from company sources
2. **Convert to SVG** if possible (better quality at all sizes)
3. **Replace the placeholder file** with the same name
4. **Test the display** in your portfolio

## Logo Specifications

- **Format**: SVG preferred, PNG acceptable
- **Dimensions**: 64x64px minimum (will be scaled down to 32x32px in UI)
- **Background**: Transparent preferred
- **Colors**: Ensure good contrast against white backgrounds

## Fallback System

The system automatically falls back to company initials if logos fail to load, so your portfolio will always look professional.

## Legal Considerations

- **Use official logos** when possible
- **Check usage rights** and restrictions
- **Credit companies** appropriately
- **Consider fair use** for portfolio purposes
